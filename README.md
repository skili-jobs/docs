Earlier app was in fully working state, but cloud was decomissioned due to lack of funds. With cloud app lost it's database, storage and auth. As of today skili-api is not deployed anywhere.

In order to make tha api work again following needs to be done

- Create database, link app with database 
- Re-implement auth
- Re-implement storage service
- Store skili job types/categories in database

Technology stack: Java, Spring Boot, Postresql DB
